# WebVNovel!

This project lets you create Visual Novels that fit on any screen! Or if you prefer only wider screens, thats ok too! 

## Status

Currently, this project is not suited for production. Novel files are not encrypted (leaks everywhere without even beginning to read!), lack of support for wider screen (soon), and lack of other features VNs have like save and load, etc. But you can still write a story with this!

## Documentation

Please read [DOCS.md](DOCS.md)

## Publishing

Everything on this repo is an static website. You can use any website publisher that supports html files, like CloudFlare Pages.
You can also test it with any http server such as `npm i -g http-server && http-server` or just `npx serve`

### What's everything you have on those folders!?

Example content. To showcase how everything works. 

I don't have any ownership on the images used in this repo. They are used here for demostrative purposes. If you want me to stop using these resources please communicate through telegram with my username OmegaSunkey.
